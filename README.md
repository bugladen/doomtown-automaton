# doomtown-automaton
An interactive web-based helper written in [Twine 2](https://twinery.org/cookbook/) and formatted in [Snowman](https://github.com/videlais/snowman).

The helper was written to:

* Ease the first-time uses of playing against the Automaton
* Facilitate the creation of additional, and possibly more complicated and archetype-specific Automatons.
