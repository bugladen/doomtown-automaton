# doomtown-automaton
An interactive web-based helper created to:
* "Automate" the Automaton for Doomtown the Card Game
* Ease the first-time uses of playing against the Automaton
* Facilitate the creation of additional, and possibly more complicated and archetype-specific Automatons
* Act as a catalyst for creation of automatons for other games

The helper was written in [Twine 2](https://twinery.org/cookbook/) and formatted for [Snowman](https://github.com/videlais/snowman).  


## Access
The helper can be accessed via browser [here](https://bit.ly/dt-automaton) to play Doomtown solo. 

It is formatted for mobile devices and is compatible with the following versions of Doomtown:
* Doomtown Reloaded
* Doomtown Wild West Edition
